# CovidData
plots covid data based on NYT dataset

This progam downloads covid data from the NYT public repository. It then uses pandas to index and plot the data.
It currently has 2 functions: Statedata() and Stateparty(),
Statedata() plots either cases or deaths for each individual state and plots them on the same graph
Stateparty() sums the data across Republican and Democrat governors and plots on the same axis
